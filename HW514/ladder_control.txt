State 10-12 are buffer states to reset montgomery multiplier, don't do anything else.
State (10),3-6,(12) implement the for-loop  ::: 12->10 or 12->7 

State 0 	Load Inputs
State 1		Start/initiate Mont(x,R2)
State 2		Wait for Done2
State 10	Reset montgomery -- buffer state
State 3		Start Mont(A,XX)
State 4		Wait for Done2
State 11	Reset montgomery -- buffer state
State 5		Start Mont(A,A) or Mont(XX,XX)
State 6		Wait for Done2				
State 12	Reset montgomery -- buffer state
State 7		Start Mont(A,1)
State 8		Wait for Done2
State 9		Calculation finished

State 0 	Load Inputs
State 1		Start/initiate Mont(x,R2)
State 2		Wait for Done1
State 10	Reset montgomery -- buffer state
State 3		Start Mont(A,XX) and Start Mont(A,A) or Mont(XX,XX)
State 4		Wait for Done1 and Done2			
State 12	Reset montgomery -- buffer state
State 7		Start Mont(A,1)
State 8		Wait for Done1
State 9		Calculation finished
