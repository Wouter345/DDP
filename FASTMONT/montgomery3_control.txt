Calculate 2 iterations at a time 
use of 2 adders in series
State 3 and 4 are the loop

State 0 	Read Inputs

State 1 	B+0  			<--first adder
		Load RegC=in_m

State 7		(Sum1=B)+(RegC_out=M)	<-- second adder
		Reset=1

State 2		Write B+M

State 3		add operand1+operand2	<-- first adder
		
State 4		add regC_out + Sum1	<-- second adder
		Figure out what action to take for 3rd and 4th iterations
		shiftA
		count up

State 5
